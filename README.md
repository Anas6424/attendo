> üîí **Access Restriction:**  
> Session data includes private academic and personal information. Only authorized users can access or interact with protected sections of the application.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note:**  
> This project relies on a custom Supabase schema. If you are using your own Supabase instance, you will need to **replicate the exact database structure** (tables, columns, relationships, etc.).  
> Without it, some features may **not function correctly or at all**.
